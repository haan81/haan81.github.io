* ### if I could remember just one moment from this past week for the rest of my life, what moment would that be?

  * from last Sunday, during 3 days, my family went to Geoje.  
  I was lived in there from 2009 to 2019 for almost 11years.   
  I was worked at Samsung heavy industries before current job.   
     
  when I was in there, there was no special thing. there was too complicate and I felt it was a remote place.    
  but during this time visiting(for leisure), I feel some different.     
  although some place have changed and some have not, I felt there like my second home town. It is probably because I have a lot of memories about there.
