    <ul>
      <li>from last Sunday, during 3 days, my family went to Geoje.<br />
I was lived in there from 2009 to 2019 for almost 11years. <br />
I was worked at Samsung heavy industries before current job.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>when I was in there, there was no special thing. there was too complicate and I felt it was a remote place.  <br />
but during this time visiting(for leisure), I feel some different.   <br />
although some place have changed and some have not, I felt there like my second home town. It is probably because I have a lot of memories about there.</p>
